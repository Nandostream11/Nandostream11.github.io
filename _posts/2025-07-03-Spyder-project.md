## üß† Introduction: Sharpening the Axe Before the Swing

In the spirit of the age-old lumberjack analogy, this project wasn't about rushing to build a robot. Instead, it was a meticulously pre-planned engineering experiment, focusing not only on functionality but on modularity, control theory, and real-time human-robot interaction.

Over the summer, I built **Quad-Spider**, a Bluetooth-controlled quadruped robot that responds to text-based motion commands from a custom Android application created using **MIT App Inventor**. This article is a deep dive into how I went from concept to prototype, and how I iterated across hardware limitations, software design, and control stability.

## ü¶ø Mechanical and Electrical Framework

### Robot Chassis & Motion

- **Leg Configuration:** 4 legs √ó 3 DOF = 12 degrees of freedom  
- **Servos:** 12 √ó SG90 servo motors (PWM-controlled)  
- **Structure:** Lightweight acrylic chassis, designed for symmetry and center-of-mass alignment  
- **Power Source:** 11.1V 2200mAh LiPo Battery regulated via a **buck converter** to 5‚Äì6V for stable servo operation  

### Pin Mapping

- **Servo Pins:** Digital Pins 2‚Äì13 (1 per servo)  
- **Bluetooth TX/RX:** Pins 10 (RX), 11 (TX) via `SoftwareSerial`  
- **Arduino Board:** Arduino Uno or Nano

## üì° Bluetooth Communication Architecture

### Module: HC-05 Bluetooth Serial Module

- **Baud Rate:** 9600  
- **Voltage Divider:** 8kŒ© & 12kŒ© resistors on RX line for 5V ‚Üí 3.3V compatibility  
- **Communication Protocol:** UART serial interpreted by Arduino and parsed via custom logic  

### Command Structure

Simple line-based protocol:
```auto
"w 5\n" // Walk forward 5 steps
"s 1\n" // Sit once
"k 3\n" // Shake leg gesture 3 times
```

Each command consists of a keyword and step count, terminated with `\n`.

## üß† Software Stack on Arduino

### Core Libraries

- `Servo.h` for PWM control  
- `FlexiTimer2.h` for periodic timed control of all 12 servos  
- `SoftwareSerial.h` for Bluetooth handling  

### Servo Timing & Synchronization

- `FlexiTimer2` used at 20ms intervals (50Hz PWM)  
- Smooth motion via step-by-step interpolation  
- Avoided servo jitter and overloads with staggered updates  

### Command Parsing Logic

Dropped `SerialCommand` in favor of memory-efficient manual parsing:
```cpp
if (BTSerial.available()) {
    char c = BTSerial.read();
    if (c == '\n') {
        parseCommand(buffer);
        buffer = "";
    } else {
        buffer += c;
    }
}
```

This allows precise one-line-at-a-time parsing with low memory overhead.
### üì± The Custom App ‚Äì Built with MIT App Inventor
#### Features

- Clean UI with command buttons (Walk, Sit, Wave, etc.)
- Input box for custom step count
- Real-time Bluetooth response display via .ReceiveText
- Handles newline-based protocol and shows only the last line for performance

#### Workflow

- On button click: send "cmd step\n" string
- Use .BytesAvailableToReceive and .ReceiveText(-1)
- Split at \n, select last item from list
- Display in label or debugger box

## üß© Design Thinking & Challenges
### Constraint-Aware Coding

- 2KB SRAM limit on Arduino Uno
- Used lean memory buffers and avoided dynamic allocations
- Pin mapping maximized usage without overlap

### Power Management

- Buck converter set to ~6V output
- Isolated logic (Arduino) from servo power to prevent resets

### Gesture Sequencing

- Each gesture was defined as a series of angles
- Step interpolation added to each transition
- Reduced jerkiness and improved accuracy

## üöÄ Conclusion: A Spider With a Brain

This robot isn't just about crawling‚Äîit's about interpreting instructions, executing gait patterns, and wirelessly interacting with a user. It blends mechanical kinematics, embedded systems, and a mobile interface for real-world human-robot communication.

What began as an idea during summer became a fully functional interactive robot‚Äîbuilt from scratch using careful planning and relentless debugging.

Feel free to fork the code, use the hardware map, or even integrate your own AI/ML layer for gesture prediction. The world of robotics is yours to spider-crawl into! üï∑Ô∏èü§ñ
