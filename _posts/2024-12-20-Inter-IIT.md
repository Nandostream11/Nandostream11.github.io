## The Problem Statement: Multi-Robot Navigation System for Dynamic Industrial Environments
To design a system for a centralized Intelligence based path planning & navigation in a dynamic condition like a warehouse with moving instruments, forklifts & humans

## Background

Bharat Forge Ltd., a flagship company of the Kalyani Group, is a global leader in precision engineering and advanced manufacturing 🏭. With complex factory and warehouse environments that are constantly evolving, their need was clear:

> **How can autonomous robots navigate and perform tasks efficiently in dynamic indoor environments — without GPS, markers, or manual intervention?**

The Inter-IIT Tech Meet 2025 problem statement challenged us to engineer a **singular brain for a swarm of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs)** to navigate and complete tasks in such unpredictable spaces.

---

## Our Approach

We designed a **ROS2-based multi-agent system** backed by a **shared NoSQL database**, capable of:
- Real-time obstacle avoidance using DWA,
- Obstacle labelling with computer vision,
- Memory persistence and map sharing,
- Scalable task assignment and navigation, and
<!-- - Human-like interaction through a chatbot.{We added this later post the Inter-IIT event} -->

> Our focus: **scalability, autonomy, and continuous learning.**


## System Architecture

### Core Components 🔁 

1. **ROS 2 Humble**: Middleware for multibot control and communication.
2. **Gazebo**: Simulated a 10x10m+ industrial workspace with dynamic and static objects.
3. **MongoDB**: A shared NoSQL database for map persistence and real-time logging.
4. **YOLOv8**: Real-time object detection of obstacles, tools, and dynamic agents.
5. **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: Intelligent path planning with dynamic prioritization.

---

## Multi-Bot Simulation Setup 📦

We created a custom **Gazebo environment** with:
- Minimum **4 autonomous robots** (Differential Drive + Quadruped variants),
- **3+ dynamic obstacles** (humans, machines),
- **10+ objects** (tools, extinguishers, parts),
- Random spawning logic for scalability testing.

Each robot published its position, task state, and sensory feedback via ROS2 topics to be logged in MongoDB.

---

## Object Detection & Environment Mapping 🧭

To reduce reliance on markers, we used **YOLOv8**, fine-tuned on:
- Fire extinguishers
- Toolboxes
- Human workers
- Warehouse equipment

> YOLO detections were timestamped and stored in MongoDB as `object_id`, `type`, `position`, and `velocity`.

These updates fed into a real-time map broadcasted using ROS2 for all swarm agents to reference.

## Shared Database & Persistent Memory 📡

_Custom collections made in Mongodb server_

We implemented a robust logging system using MongoDB making two collections:
```json
{
  "robot_logs": {
    "timestamp": "2025-07-05T15:00:00Z",
    "robot_id": "bot_1",
    "X": 3.1, "Y": 7.2,
    "obstacles": [...],
    "confidence_score": "confidence_score",
    "scan_ranges": "scan_ranges",
    "tasks_done": "navigating"
  },
  "map_data": {
    "environment_id": "sector_2",
    "map_data": [...],
    "last_updated": "2025-07-05T14:58:10Z",
  }
}
```

This enabled task resumption and dynamic path re-evaluation even after failure or system restarts.

## Task Ranking & Autonomous Scheduling 📋

Every robot fetched tasks from a central MongoDB tasks collection, ranked by:
    Estimated time to reach,
    Object priority (e.g., emergency tools > inspection points),
    Current robot availability.

We used a RL based technique(PPO with DWA) and updated task assignments in real-time, ensuring optimal efficiency across the swarm. This method was inspired from a research paper.

<!-- ## 💬 Bonus Feature: LLM-Powered Chatbot Interface

To increase usability, we created a chatbot powered by OpenAI's GPT model:
Example Conversation:

User: "Find the nearest fire extinguisher."
Bot: "Assigning bot_2 to the extinguisher in Sector B."
GUI Output: "Robot bot_2 has reached the fire extinguisher."

    This layer made it incredibly intuitive for supervisors to assign and monitor tasks. -->

## Simulation Results 🎥
We showcased 4 key scenarios in Gazebo:
- Scalability in Larger Environments – 20x20m maps with high clutter.
- Swarm Size Flexibility – 8+ bots navigating collaboratively.
- Dynamic Obstacle Handling – Human avatars moving unpredictably.
- Map Regeneration & Persistence – Reloading environments from stored maps.

Video demos and performance logs were uploaded to the GitHub repository.
- AI Models Behind the Scenes
- YOLOv8: Custom-trained for object detection; inference integrated into ROS2 node.
- RL Agent: Trained in simulated environments to learn safe navigation patterns in presence of moving agents.
- Costmap Layer: ROS2 Nav2's layered costmap used to merge YOLO data with LiDAR and odometry for real-time updates.

    Solving Bharat Forge’s Inter-IIT challenge gave us deep insights into how modern robotics, AI, and scalable software architecture can come together to transform industries. Our solution not only achieves markerless indoor autonomy but lays the foundation for factory-wide AMR coordination at scale.
