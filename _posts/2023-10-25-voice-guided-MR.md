# Ever heard of the need to operate in an uninhabitable zone
 wearing heavy and fully secured suits?

Yeah those radioactive chambers or environments which have to be checked to extract some material or to check the radiation levels. Or just think of a space where it's not possible for organic matter to enter & leave without harm. 

These protocols not only make the process finance-intensive but also delay the main task of sampling or on-site testing. Ofcourse the most plausible robotics solution is to send a Radio-controlled(joypad-based) mobile robot(if it's a plane terrain;). . This project was aimed at addressing modular task based situations where the tasks could be divided into multiple steps and the accuracy of movement(distance & direction as desired) in each step is more important than controllability
