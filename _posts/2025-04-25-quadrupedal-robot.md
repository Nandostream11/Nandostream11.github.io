This was a collaborative project that was executed in two different phases during my B.Tech at [IIT Bhilai](https://www.iitbhilai.ac.in/)- \
Phase I (The Design & Basic working Prototype) & Phase II (High Level Layer and Prototype improvements for Navigation)

## **Phase I**

The **Design Phase**, in which I worked on the electronics and learned the design aspects while working with my senior, [Santosh K. Prajapat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/santosh-kumar-prajapat). In this phase the legged robot was designed from scratch with some design experimentation and analytical approach. Apart from the leg designs, the main body was kept as a flat plate unlike the cylindrical structure seen in service robots like Unitree Go1/2. This robot was prepared as a part of a Robotics Fundamentals course curriculum and we reached some basic Low level embedded & MATLAB programmed stage could command the robot to move in 3 degrees (x, y, yaw) with a joystick. \

We first programmmed a single Leg with the analogy of a robotic Arm

## **Phase II**

The $2^{nd}$ Phase project with my  with two of my batchmates- [Dhananjay A.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhananjay-abbot-3ba776198), [Harshit K](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harshit-k-1aa799276) and a senior, [Vedhamsh Bode](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vedhamsh-bode-09a147229)
