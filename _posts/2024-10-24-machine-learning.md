## Introduction  
With the increasing reliance on AI-driven chatbots in mental health and support services, the ability of machines to engage empathetically has never been more important. Traditional Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) models often fall shortâ€”they provide surface-level comfort but lack the depth needed to truly understand and respond to human emotions.

*The need of a novel mechanism in ES Conversation*

Our project, **CauESC: A Causal-Aware Emotional Support Conversation Model**, addresses this gap. Developed as part of our Machine Learning curriculum under the guidance of **Dr. Rajesh Kumar Mundotiya**, CauESC integrates causal reasoning and commonsense knowledge to enhance empathy in AI-driven conversations.  

## Problem Statement  
Emotional Support Conversation models aim to comfort individuals in distress. However, existing approaches face three critical limitations:  

![Problems](/assets/images/esc-problems.png){: w="500" }
*Limitations of existing approaches*

1. **Inability to Identify Root Causes** â€“ Most models respond only to the immediate context, overlooking deeper emotional triggers.  
2. **Static Interaction** â€“ Responses fail to dynamically adapt to evolving emotional states.  
3. **Lack of Empathy** â€“ Generated replies often sound generic, leaving users feeling misunderstood.  

These shortcomings can lead to user frustration, undermining the very purpose of emotional support systems.  

## Our Approach: CauESC  
CauESC builds upon prior research while introducing novel elements to address these challenges:  

![CauESC architecture](/assets/images/ml-archi.png){: w="500" }
*CauESC architecture*

- **Cause-Aware Encoding** â€“ The model identifies the underlying causes of emotional distress using attention mechanisms.  
- **Integration of Commonsense Knowledge** â€“ Leveraging **COMET (Commonsense Transformers)**, CauESC reasons about both *intra-effects* (impact on the userâ€™s emotions) and *inter-effects* (impact on conversation flow).  
- **Multi-Strategy Execution** â€“ The model can combine strategies like reflection of feelings, suggestions, and self-disclosure within a single response for more personalized support.  

This makes CauESC not only contextually aware but also causally informedâ€”a step closer to real empathy in AI.  

## Dataset and Preparation  
We used the **ESConv dataset**, a benchmark for emotional support conversations. The dataset was carefully annotated to capture:  
![Dataset strategy](/assets/images/ml-dataset.png){: w="500" }

- **Emotion Causes** â€“ Identifying utterances that triggered distress.  
- **Support Strategies** â€“ Categorizing different supportive techniques.  
- **Emotional Effects** â€“ Tracking changes in the seekerâ€™s emotional state.  

Data cleaning was also a crucial step to ensure ethical integrity and model reliability.  

## Implementation Highlights  
1. **COMET Integration** â€“ Instead of simply analyzing conversation context, CauESC feeds supporter utterances into COMET to generate causal inferences about emotional outcomes.  
2. **Cause-Aware Attention Mechanism** â€“ Helps the model focus on the root cause rather than just the latest message.  
3. **Strategy Executor** â€“ Dynamically combines multiple support strategies for coherent, empathetic responses.

*Common Sense transformer Integration in ESC generation*

The architecture effectively bridges the gap between emotion recognition and empathetic response generation.  

## Results and Insights  
Through experimentation, CauESC demonstrated:  

- Better recognition of **emotional distress causes** compared to traditional ESC models.  
- More **contextually appropriate responses**, guided by commonsense reasoning.  
- Increased potential to sustain meaningful emotional engagement with users in distress.

*Abstract view of workflow*

While challenges in dataset consistency and fine-tuning persisted, our progress validated the promise of causal-aware approaches in emotional AI.  

## Conclusion  
CauESC represents a step forward in building emotionally intelligent conversational agents. By incorporating causal reasoning and commonsense knowledge, the model lays the foundation for chatbots that donâ€™t just listen, but truly understand.  

This project not only fulfilled our academic objectives but also underscored the real-world importance of empathy in AI systems. Future work can expand CauESC into scalable, real-time applications in mental health and beyond, paving the way for technology that meaningfully supports human well-being.
