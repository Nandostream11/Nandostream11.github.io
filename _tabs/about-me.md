<span style="font-size:1.5em;">Hi there! This is Anand.</span>

This is about Robotics, Design & Perception  \
Hi, I'm a passionate robotics engineer with a strong inclination toward intelligent systems, design, and perception. My experience spans the development of legged and mobile robots, focusing on systems capable of robust navigation across real-world terrains. Having worked on Legged Robots and Mobile Robots, I look forward to collaborating on Drone-based(Underwater) projects. 

While building on the 4-Legged Robot and Mobile Robots for autonomous terrain traversal, Iâ€™m actively exploring underwater robotic systems and drone-based applications, particularly interested in the challenges of marine autonomy, such as localization and communication in GPS-denied environments. I thrive at the intersection of hardware and software, continuously working to bridge mechanical design, electronics, and algorithmic control. I am always open to collaboration and discussions that push the boundaries of autonomous systems, and I look forward to contributing meaningfully to the future of robotics.

Learning to integrate Machine Learning into robotic control systems for adaptive and intelligent behavior. Always working on real-world robotics problems with an aim to push boundaries in autonomous systems
