<span style="font-size:1.5em;">Hi there! This is Anand.</span>

I am a passionate robotics engineer with a strong inclination toward intelligent systems, design, and perception. My experience spans the development of legged and mobile robots, focusing on robust systems. 

I thrive at the intersection of hardware and software, working to bridge mechanical design, electronics, and algorithmic control through software frameworks. I am always open to collaboration and discussions that push the boundaries of autonomous systems, and I look forward to contributing meaningfully to the future of robotics.
